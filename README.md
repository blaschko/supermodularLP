Code for the experiments described in: Blaschko, M. B.: Slack and Margin Rescaling as Convex Extensions of Supermodular Functions. arXiv:1606.05918, 2016.

This code makes use of several functions from Krause, A: SFO: A Toolbox for Submodular Function Optimization, JMLR, 2010.

Data can be downloaded from the CIFAR subset of the 80-million tiny images dataset: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Code has been run on both Matlab and Octave - most recently on Octave, may need some small changes for Matlab.

start with runExperiments.m
